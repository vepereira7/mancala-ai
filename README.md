# Mancala - Artificial Intelligence

This project was carried out as part of the AI course and the main goal was to implement and test different game modes and algorithms to solve the game. The chosen board game was mancala.

## Abstract
This paper examines and explores the implementation of the Mancala game and the application of the Minimax search method and Minimax with Alpha- Beta cuts using different heuristics to solve versions of the game with different difficulties. The Mancala game has been implemented with three different game modes and adaptable difficulties. The game modes implemented were the following: Human versus Human, Human versus AI and AI versus AI. This report will explain the formulation of the problem, its implementation and the results achieved by the search methods. Results show that the implementation of these search methods have fairly different results, being the Minimax with alpha-beta cuts with a complex heuristic the one with the best results. These results, referring to the AI playing against the AI, are evaluated by number of moves, time and memory usage. Several tests were made, and when we confront minimax against alpha-beta pruning, the minimax proved to be better algorithm since it won four games in total of six. Regarding memory, moves and time, alpha-beta has slightly better results as expected.
